## Add Credits and Attributions
All the way at the bottom of your StoryMap you can add Credits and Attributions. Here is a great place to note any organization you're working with or cite your research references.

## Publish 
Hit the publish button to have your work made public. If you make any edits or changes after publishing, you need to hit publish again to have them reflected in StoryMap that users will encounter.
