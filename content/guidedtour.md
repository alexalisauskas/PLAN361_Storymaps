## Guided Map Tours

You can create a map tour to showcase a set of places. You can decide whether your readers get to explore these places in any order, or are led through in an order of your choosing.

If you have a folder of images you want to use in your Map Tour, you can select Upload Photos to batch upload them. Don't worry too much about the order, as you will be prompted to confirm your selection of images and the order they go in. Each image will populate your tour with one point.

You will be prompted to select a Map Tour type. For your assignment you should select Guided Tour. Guided leads the reader through an order of your choosing, whereas Explorer allows the reader to peruse on their own.

For Guided Tour, there are two options
- Media Focused which features an image or video in the main right panel
- Map Focused which features a map in the main right panel

When you choose a layout, a new content block will be added to your StoryMap. It will look something like the below. The bottom banner contains the "Slides" of your map. Each slide displays some text and/or multimedia, and is connected to a location on the map.

## Add a Tour Point
Each slide on your Guided Map Tour is a point consisting of 3 components
- A panel for title and description. As part of the description you can add text, audio or a button. This button is useful if you want to link out to a different part of your Storymap (for instance if you want to include sections with more text).
- A media panel for images or videos of each place
- A map panel to locate that point

To add a location, click on the first Slide and select "Add location". Now, you can either search the location on the top-right, or zoom-in to it. With your cursor as a crosshair, click the location and save. Once you choose a point and click "Add to map", there are two options of zoom level that you can select when you add a location. Using map tour setting will automatically adjust the zoom level so all points are visible simultaneously. Use current zoom level will keep the zoom level always be street or city. You can always go back and edit locations later.
