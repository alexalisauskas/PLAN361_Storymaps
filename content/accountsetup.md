## ArcGIS Free vs. Enterprise Account
An ArcGIS free account can be created by anyone and is intended for noncommercial, nongovernmental use. Most features including audio, timlines, and image galleries are now available with the free acount. When using ArcGIS StoryMaps with a public account, some advanced storytelling and customization features are not available, including:

- embedding web pages
- customizing story theme and logo
- Google analytics tracking ID
- Categorized layers

You can still include images and video, embed map tours, and use the swipe tool. You can read more about features on the [ArcGIS Storymap Licensing page](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-storymaps/reference/licensing.htm).
